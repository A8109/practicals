    <div style="font-family:sans-serif;"><p style="font-size:150%;"> I am quite depressed today as she as in Mansha gave me some ass kicking that I am not doing enough and at the same time I have a lot of thing to do. I have to prepare for Cat Cds and alongside I have to look for a job. I am pissed at her, But deep down I am more upset with me that with her. I don't want to talk to anyone. Writing down all these things helps me implore my emotions. I can't find a single work from home job that will pay me certainly 6k a month and I'm very disatisfied with my performance.</p></div>
